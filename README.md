✨ Ta-Da List: A Dopamine-First Productivity Dashboard
Ta-Da List is a task management dashboard designed specifically for ADHD brains, focusing on visual reward, reduced friction, and "tiny wins." Unlike standard to-do lists that feel like endless chores, this app transforms task completion into a celebration (Ta-Da! 🎉).

Built with a stunning Glassmorphism UI and a calming "Pink Dream" aesthetic, it combines essential executive function tools into a single, distraction-free interface.

Key Features:

🧩 Eisenhower Matrix: Visually prioritize tasks into Do First, Plan, Delegate, and Eliminate to beat decision paralysis.

⏱️ Integrated Focus Timers: Tasks come with built-in countdowns (Play/Pause/Reset) to facilitate time-blocking and prevent time blindness.

💊 Daily Habits & Sleep Tracker: A "ghost-text" habit widget that lets you track hydration, workouts, and sleep goals with a smart countdown clock for bedtime.

📝 Quick Scratchpad: A transparent, always-visible notepad for capturing fleeting thoughts before they vanish.

💾 Auto-Save: Powered by localStorage, your data persists instantly across reloads—no login required.

Tech Stack: HTML5, CSS3 (Variables, Grid, Flexbox), Vanilla JavaScript.

Stop staring at a wall of text. Start turning "To-Do" into "Ta-Da!"
